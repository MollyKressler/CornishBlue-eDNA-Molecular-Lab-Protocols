See Table 4 for a full list of qPCR parts and prices. 

### Step 1 - Preparing reagents 

1. Step 1 must be conducted in the eDNA extraction lab. 
2. Clean working surfaces with 70% ethanol, followed by 10% bleach, and then 70% ethanol solution. 
3. Remove your probe, primers and qPCR Biosystems mastermix from the freezer.
4. Add distilled water to the tubes your probe and primers were delivered in as instructed on your order form in order to dilute the precipitates to a concentration of 100 nmol/μl.
5. Once the water has been added to your primers and probe, spin them at 13,000 g for 1.5 mins to mix. 
6. In a new 1.5 mL tube, add your probe, primers and water to make a Primer Probe Mix (see Table 1). 

##### Table 1. Reagents required to make 50 μl of Primer Probe Mix. Vortex all.
Reagent | Concentration (nmol/μl) | Vol (μl) 
--- | --- | ---
Probe | 100 | 2
Forward primer | 100 | 4
Reverse primer | 100 | 4
Distilled water | N/A | 40

7. Put the reagents that you're not using back in the freezer. 
8. Vortex all primers first. Make a megamix by adding your mastermix, primer probe mix and distilled water together in a 1 mL tube (see Table 2).  
##### Table 2. Reagents required to make the Megamix
Reagent | Vol for 1 reaction (μl) | Vol for 53 reactions (μl)
--- | --- | ---
Mastermix | 5 | 265
Primer Probe Mix | 1| 53
Distilled water | 3 | 159

9. Take your megamix to the pre-PCR side of the main lab (131). 

### Step 2 - Loading the qPCR plate

10. Clean working surfaces with 70% ethanol, followed by 10% bleach, and then 70% ethanol solution. 
11. Take your sample(s) out of the freezer. 
12. Turn the qPCR machine on. 
13. Place a qPCR plate into a plate holder and turn the light on. 
15. Add 9 μl of megamix to each qPCR well from right to left (see Table 3). Positive control (1µl of the standard) always goes in the top right well, and always added outside the eDNA room, in the qPCR lab. Negative control (distilled water from field) always in the bottom right well.

##### Table 3. Reagents to be pipetted into each qPCR well  
Reagent | Vol (μl) 
--- | ---
Megamix | 4
Template | 1 

(skip steps 14, 16-18 from original protocol)
19. In each well, add 9μl of megamix and 1µl of sample. Vortext, and divide each sample (e.g. WBT1.1) into 3 wells. 
20. Add 1 μl of distilled water to negative control wells. 
21. Gently tap the plate to cause the megamix to fall to the bottom of the wells.
22. Add a plastic seal (without cracks in it) to the top of the qPCR plate making sure that all the sides are tightly sealed by using the grey plastic tool.
23. Vortex the qPCR plate to remove any bubbles that have formed in the bottom of the wells. Bubbles are OK at the top of the wells but not at the bottom. 
24. Spin the qPCR plate in the spinner if bubbles persist to remove them.

### Step 3 - Running the qPCR

25. Place qPCR plate in the machine while setting up the plate layout on the laptop (to, hopefully, let the bubbles time to burst in the heat). Put the qPCR plate in the qPCR machine.
26. Open the laptop: Eco (not Eco Study) --> file --> open --> select eco.t files in the drop down list.  
27. Open EcoStudio and find EcoD file.  
28. Press run.

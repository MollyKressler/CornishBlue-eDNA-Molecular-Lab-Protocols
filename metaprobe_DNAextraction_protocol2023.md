## Protocol for extracting eDNA from Metaprobe 2.0 samples,
##### or any cotton-gauze based sampling method with preservation in absolute ethanol

Developed based on Maiello et al. Little samplers, big fleet: eDNA metabarcoding from commercial trawlers enhances ocean monitoring 2022. *Fisheries Research*. [doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.106259]

One Metaprobe 2.0 sample consists of 3 cotton-gauze rolls suspended in 98% ethanol in 50mL centrifuge tubes. The following protocol is for laboratory based extraction of eDNA from rolls of cotton-gauze from one sample. **Updated following correspondence from Guilia Maiello**.

**By Molly M Kressler**

#### Things to do before you start:

* Wipe down the surfaces, oven, centrifuge, pipettes, door handles, everything, with 70% ethanol followed by 10% bleach, followed by 70% ethanol (the "EBE" clean).
* Soak the centrifuge rotors in 10% bleach solution for no longer than 2 h (the rotor may corode if left too long), triple rinse, and dry.
* Ensure you have sufficient gloves, towels, tips, sweetie jars, tubes etc.
#### Important notes on DNA extraction:
* It is important to do the ethanol-bleach-ethanol "EBE" clean because several of the extraction buffers contain chaotropic salts that react with bleach to form highly toxic compounds (basically mustard gas!). If formed this compound will appear yellow on the paper towels and may smell pleasant and garlicky.
* ALWAYS use filter tips.
* ALWAYS number every tube.
* Make aliquots of all your buffers and reagents because you could easily spill or contaminate them.
* For every extraction day in the lab, also do an extraction blank with just extraction reagents; otherwise treat it the same as the others. 
* Read the full [DNeasy kit instructions](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=6b09dfb8-6319-464d-996c-79e8c7045a50&lang=en) to understand the basics of nucleic acid isolation.
* Photograph your lab book at the end of every day as a backup.
* Check the temp of the oven using the thermometer inside, as the external thermostat is inaccurate.

## Extraction Steps
**Day 1**
1. Put gloves on. Remove samples from freezer and place on side. 
3. Prepare tubes of extraction (ATL) buffer and proteinase K (20µg/µL). In a 30mL falcon tube with a conical base, vortex together 540 µL of extraction ATL buffer and 60 µL of proteinase K. Vortex immediately and place in a tube rack. 
4. To prepare rolls of gauze samples, using fine tip tweezers remove the rolls of gauze from the tubes of ethanol and place them in a petri dish. Allow the samples to sit in the petri dishes for 5-8 minutes, so some of the ethanol can evaporate. 
5. Cut three small pieces (~ 2x2 cm) from each roll of gauze in a Petri dish. Try to take small pieces of gauze from different part of the roll in order to have pieces from different sections of the roll of gauze (see picture and hashed squares). Place all three cuts into the same falcon tube with extraction buffer and proteinase K. Label the tube according to the sample number.

6. Change scissors and tweezers between each roll of gauze (i.e. sampling replicate) Place used scissors and tweezers into a small 10% bleach bath, fully submerging the tools. Let them soak for 5-10 minutes before placing them on blue roll to air-dry. They should air-dry for a few minutes (3-5) before being used for any successive sampling replicates. 
7. Incubate the cut samples in the falcon tubes with caps on overnight in an oven at 50ºC. 
8. For each extraction day you must make an extraction blank. To make a blank, vortex 315µL of ATL buffer and 35µL of proteinase-K into a 1.5mL eppendorf. Label the eppendorf and place the eppendorf in the oven to incubate overnight with the samples. Treat the extraction blank as one replicate throughout the rest of the extraction process. 


**Day 2**
1. Wipe down surfaces following the EBE method. Put gloves on and remove samples from oven. Label three sets of eppendorfs with the corresponding sample numbers, and place these in a clean tube rack.
2. Using a 1000µL filter tip and pipette, pipette the liquid from the falcon tubes into eppendorfs. You should be able to collect between 500-700µL of supernatant depending on how wet the gauzes were when they went into the falcon tubes the night before.
3. Centrifuge the sample for 1.5 min at 13,000 g to collect debris.
4. Transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take care to not disturb the pellet. Discard tube with debris.
5. Centrifuge again, but for 3 min at 20,000 g.
6. Transfer 350 µL of supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take care to not disturb any pellet. Transfer another 350µL of supernatant to a second new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to disturb the pellet. If you cannot get a full 350µL of supernatant from a second pull, that's fine. Don't repeat this for remaining supernatant, this is enough and any more will likely risk disturbing the pellet. Discard the tube with pellet debris.
7. In a 50 mL centrifuge tube prepare a mastermix of buffer AL (pre-warmed) and ethanol. You will need 350 µL of each for every sample, plus 10% extra. 
   For Metaprobe samples, you will typically have two 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes with 350µL (or close to) supernatant. So for 12 samples and one extraction blank (or 25 total microcentrifuge tubes), vortex the following volumes:
    
| Samples   | AL Buffer | Absolute ethanol (99.8%) |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 24+1 (25) | 9625µL    | 9625µL                   |
| 1         | 385µL     | 385µL                    |

*Table 1. Volumes for Step 7 master mix of Al buffer and ethanol*

8. Into each 350µL of supernatant, add 700 µL of this mastermix to your supernatant, and vortex each samples IMMEDIATELY (important). You will know you have mixed sufficiently when the liquid in the tube looks clear and smooth, and not bumpy or textured.
9. Remove one spin column from the DNeasy kit for each sampling replicate (NOT each microcentrifuge tube). Label the caps with the appropriate sample numbers.
10. Add 525 µL of this mixture from step 13 to the DNeasy spin column. Take care to pipette the contents gently and from the bottom of the column to prevent salt contamination around the rim. 
    *You will need to repeat this step for each sampling replicate until all the supernatant + master mix from Step 13 has passed through the spin column in the centrifuge. You have to do this 525 µL at a time, because that is the maximum volume of the spin columns.*
11. Centrifuge for 1.5 min at 13,000 g.
12. Remove the column from the collection tube and carefully pipette out the liquid from the collection tube and discard this liquid by ejecting the full pipette tip. Do not dispose of the collection tube.
13. Repeat steps 12/13 to pass another 525 µL through the column.
14. Discard collection tube and contents, and place column in new collection tube.
15. Add 600 µL buffer AW1 to the spin column and centrifuge for 1.5 min at 13,000 g. Be sure to add the buffer gently from the bottom as before.
16. Use a pipette to remove contents of the collection tube, place column back in the collection tube, being careful to not let the spin column touch the side of the tube, and dispose of the pipette tip. 
17. Add 600 µL buffer AW2 to the spin column and centrifuge for 1.5 min at 13,000 g. Be sure to add the buffer gently from the bottom as before.
18. Use a pipette to remove the liquid from the collection tube as before. Be careful to not let the liquid touch the bottom of the spin column.
19. Centrifuge the spin column and empty collection tube again, this time for 3 min at 20,000 g.
20. Transfer the column to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with the cap cut off.
21. Open the spin column cap for 2 min to allow ethanol to evaporate.
22. Add 105 &micro;L of the pre-warmed AE elution buffer. 
23. Close caps and incubate in the oven at 56&#176;C for 5 mins. 
24. Centrifuge the spin column at 13,000 g for 1.5 mins to release the DNA.
25. Pipette the eluate back into the spin column and repeat step 28.
26. Pipette eluate into final microcentrifuge tube and label microcentrifuge tube with a cryo-baby printed label. 

### Nanodrop/Qubit for concentration and purity 
27. Nanodrop/Qubit 1µL and record the double stranded DNA (dsDNA) concentration (ng/µL) as well as the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios.
28. Place samples in a dark sample box, and place in a -20°C freezer. Label the box with a piece of tape and write the project, date and your name, etc.
29. Clean the lab again following the EBE method.

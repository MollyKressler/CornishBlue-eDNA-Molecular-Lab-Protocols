# Protocols for eDNA extraction from Sterivex filters
### Rupert A. Collins :: December 2020

This protocol is a simple DNA extraction method for ATL-buffer-preserved eDNA from Sterivex filters, and is similar to that of [Spens et al. (2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12683). The inhibitor removal step is optional but recommended. A qPCR standard curve assay will indicate if inhibitors are present. 

### Before you start

#### Kit required (manufacturers and part numbers are presented in Table 1 at the bottom): 

* DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
* OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (optional)
* RNase A
* 50 mL centrifuge tubes
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (LoBind)
* Bleach
* Absolute ethanol
* Paper towels
* Disposible gloves
* White masking tape

#### Things to do before you start (usually the evening before):

* Wipe down the surfaces, oven, centrifuge, pipettes, door handles, everything, with 70% ethanol followed by 10% bleach, followed by 70% ethanol (the "EBE" clean).
* Soak the centrifuge rotors in 10% bleach solution for no longer than 2 h (the rotor may corode if left too long), triple rinse, and dry.
* Mop the floor with 5% bleach solution.
* Run the UV lamp for at least 2 h. 
* Ensure you have sufficient gloves, towels, tips, sweetie jars, tubes etc.

### Important notes on DNA extraction:

* It is important to do the ethanol-bleach-ethanol "EBE" clean because several of the extraction buffers contain chaotropic salts that react with bleach to form highly toxic compounds (basically mustard gas!). If formed this compound will appear yellow on the paper towels and may smell pleasant and garlicky.
* ALWAYS use filter tips.
* ALWAYS change gloves after EVERY step.
* ALWAYS number every tube.
* Make aliquots of all your buffers and reagents because you could easily spill or contaminate them.
* For every extraction day in the lab, also do an extraction blank with just extraction reagents and no Sterivex; otherwise treat it the same as the others. 
* Read the full [DNeasy kit instructions](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=6b09dfb8-6319-464d-996c-79e8c7045a50&lang=en) to understand the basics of nucleic acid isolation.
* Photograph your lab book at the end of every day as a backup.
* Check the temp of the oven using the thermometer inside, as the external thermostat is inaccurate.

### Extraction steps:

1. Turn on the oven and preheat the AL and AE buffers at 56&#176;C.
2. Label the Sterivex by putting on masking tape, writing on the number, then another layer of tape. This means that the labels will not be lost should one of the Sterivex leak in the shaker. See:

3. Open the Sterivex, add 5 &micro;L of proteinase K and 2 &micro;L of RNase A. Close with the same combistopper and shake to mix.
4. Put in the oven shaker to incubate for 2 h. Return after 1 h to rearrange and check; this makes sure some samples don't get stuck and stop moving.
5. Remove combistopper and place an inverted 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube over the Sterivex inlet. Place an inverted 50 mL centrifuge tube over the top of both. Quickly flip so tubes are back the right way up and the Sterivex contents can drain into the microcentrifuge tube. See:

6. Centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 g.
7. With sterilised tweezers remove the Sterivex and discard. Then remove the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube carefully.
8. Centrifuge the sample for 1.5 min at 13,000 g to collect debris.
9. Transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take care to not disturb the pellet. Discard tube with debris.
10. Centrifuge again, but for 3 min at 20,000 g.
11. Transfer 350 &micro;L of supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take care to not disturb any pellet. Discard tube with debris.
12. In a new 50 mL centrifuge tube prepare a mastermix of buffer AL (pre-warmed) and ethanol. You will need 350 &micro;L of each for every sample, plus 10% extra. So, for 5 samples, add 1,925 &micro;L of buffer AL and 1,925 &micro;L of ethanol. Vortex to mix.
13. Add 700 &micro;L of this mastermix to your supernatant, and vortex each samples IMMEDIATELY (important).
14. Add 525 &micro;L of this mixture from step 13 to the DNeasy spin column. take care to pipette the contents gently and from the bottom of the column to prevent salt contamination around the rim. 
15. Centrifuge for 1.5 min at 13,000 g.
16. Remove the column from the collection tube and carefully pipette out the liquid from the collection tube and discard this liquid by ejecting the full pipette tip.
17. Repeat steps 12/13 to pass another 525 &micro;L through the column.
18. Discard collection tube and contents, and place column in new collection tube.
19. Add 600 &micro;L buffer AW1 to the spin column and centrifuge for 1.5 min at 13,000 g. Be sure to add the buffer gently from the bottom as before.
20. Discard collection tube and contents, and place column in new collection tube. Be careful to not let the liquid touch the bottom of the spin column.
21. Add 600 &micro;L buffer AW2 to the spin column and centrifuge for 1.5 min at 13,000 g. Be sure to add the buffer gently from the bottom as before.
22. Use a pipette to remove the liquid from the collection tube as before. Be careful to not let the liquid touch the bottom of the spin column.
23. Centrifuge the spin column and empty collection tube again, this time for 3 min at 20,000 g.
24. Transfer the column to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with the cap cut off.
25. Open the spin column cap for 2 min to allow ethanol to evaporate.
26. Add 105 &micro;L of the pre-warmed AE elution buffer. 
27. Close caps and incubate in the oven at 56&#176;C for 5 mins. 
28. Centrifuge the spin column at 13,000 g for 1.5 mins to release the DNA.
29. If required for low yield samples, pipette the eluate back into the spin column and repeat step 28.

### Inhibitor removal, quantification, and storage

1. Pass the eluted DNA through a Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor removal column (following manufacturer's instrunctions), and into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with cap removed.
2. Transfer the eluate into a labelled 1.5 mL LoBind microcentrifuge tube for long term storage. For a tube labelling system, I write the date, and the extraction number from that day, e.g. 08.08.19/4 which would be the fourth sample done on the 8th of August 2019. Refer to the lab book to know which field event this corresponds to
3. Nanodrop 1 &micro;L and record DNA concentration (ng/&micro;L) as well as the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios.
4. Freeze in the eDNA freezer, in a well labelled box (name, date, project etc). Use tape or a piece of card for the labels instead of writing on the box directly with a marker pen.
5. Clean the lab again following steps at the beginning.

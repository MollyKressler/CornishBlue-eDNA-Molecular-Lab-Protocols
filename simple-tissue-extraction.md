# Protocol for cheap and simple tissue extractions 
### Rupert A. Collins :: May 2021

This protocol is for a cheap and simple genomic DNA extractions from ethanol preserved or frozen fish tissues (fin clips or muscle). Produces DNA suitable for regular PCR applications such as DNA barcoding.

### Before you start

#### Kit required (manufacturers and part numbers are presented in Table 1 at the bottom)

* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
* 1.5 mL "Lo-Bind" microcentrifuge tubes (optional).
* 50 mL centrifuge tubes.
* Absolute ethanol (stores).
* Molecular grade water (DNase/RNase-Free).
* Milli-Q water (found in wash room).
* Proteinase K.
* RNAse-A (optional).
* Nuclei Lysis Solution.
* Protein Precipitation Solution.
* EB buffer or TE buffer.
* A4 paper, roughly cut into quarters.
* Scalpel blades.
* Small tweezers.
* Bunsen burner.
* 200 &micro;L filter tips.
* 1000 &micro;L filter tips.
* Tube racks.
* Sample boxes.
* 10% Bleach and 70% ethanol to clean bench.
* Paper towels, disposible gloves etc.
* Your tissue samples.

#### The day before (or several hours)

* Prepare fresh 50 mL stocks of 100% and 70% ethanol and place in the -20&#176;C chest freezer [IMPORTANT NOTE: for the 70%, remember to measure the ethanol (35 mL) and Milli-Q water (15 mL) seperately and then combine, due to their different densities].
* Make up stocks of DNA elution buffer (see step Appendix 1).
* Pre-freeze a tube rack.
* In the main lab wipe down the bench with 70% ethanol followed by 10% bleach, followed by 70% ethanol (the "EBE" ethanol-bleach-ethanol clean).
* Ensure you have sufficient gloves, towels, tips, sweetie jars, tubes etc.

### Step 1. Tissue subsampling

* Add 200 &micro;L of Nuclei Lysis Solution and 1-5 &micro;L Proteinase K (depending on sample quantity) to _n_ labelled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (RNAse-A can also be added at this point, if no RNA work is planned).
* Retrieve the tissue sample from its tube with the small tweezers, and place on a fresh piece of cut A4 paper.
* With the scalpel blade, cut off approximately 2 mm<sup>3</sup> of the tissue and allow a few minutes for any ethanol to evaporate.
* Place the tissue into the corresponding 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
* Discard the paper, clean the scalpel blade and forceps with a soapy paper towel, rinse with ethanol, and quickly pass the tools over the bunsen on blue flame to sterilise [IMPORTANT NOTE: set up the bunsen safely on another bench well away from any ethanol and paper, and always put to yellow flame when not in direct use].
* Repeat for all samples.

### Step 2: Incubation and cell lysis

This step bursts the cells, releasing DNA, and digests any proteins in the tissue sample, including deoxyribonucleases (DNases).

* Vortex, and place the tubes into the dry-bath incubator set to 56&#176;C.
* Return every 30 minutes to vortex and check tissues.
* Once tissues are completely or nearly completely lysed (i.e. have broken down into mostly liquid), remove, and turn off dry-bath.

### Step 3. Remove cell debris

This step cleans up and removes any leftover solid tissue that did not lyse.

* Centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 g.
* Gently pour or pipette the aqueous part of the lysed sample into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to allow any of the debris to carry over.
* The DNA is in the clear liquid in the new tube. Discard the previous tube containing the debris.

### Step 4. Protein precipitation

This step pulls all proteins out of the lysed tissue solution.

* Add 65 &micro;L of Protein Precipitation Solution, and vortex each tube immediately.
* Centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 g.
* Gently pour the aqueous part of the lysed sample into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to allow any of the precipitate (the solid material) to carry over.
* The DNA is in the clear liquid in the new tube. Discard the previous tube containing the debris.

### Step 5. DNA precipitation

This step now pulls the DNA out of solution and binds it to the tube.

* Add 600 &micro;L of the "frozen" 100% ethanol straight from the -20&#176;C freezer.
* Close tube lid and gently invert 20 times to mix.
* Transfer to the pre-frozen rack, incubate in the freezer at -20&#176;C for 30 mins, while pre-chilling the centrifuge to 4&#176;C.
* Centrifuge for 15 min at 15,000 g and 4&#176;C, and place tube rack back in the freezer.
* Gently pour off the ethanol [IMPORTANT NOTE: you should see the white DNA pellet/smear at the base of the tube, so take care not to disturb it when you pour].

### Step 6. Wash and remove impurities

* Add 600 &micro;L of pre-frozen 70% EtOH (-20&#176;C).
* Gently invert once.
* As before, pour off the ethanol and take care not to disturb the pellet.

### Step 7. Dry the DNA pellet

* Place the tubes on a paper towel on their sides, and slightly elevate the bottom of the tube with paper so gravity can drain the tubes.
* Cover with another paper towel, and add a note to not disturb.
* Leave overnight or several hours.

### Step 8. Resuspend the pellet

* Add 55 &micro;L of Tris or TE buffer (see notes on buffers below).
* Incubate in the dry-bath for 1 h at 56Â°C.
* Flick to mix at regular intervals, to ensure the pellet is fully dissolved into the buffer [IMPORTANT NOTE: do not vortex as this will shear and fragment any high molecular weight DNA].

### Step 9. Quantify and store.

* Transfer 50 &micro;L to a labelled 1.5 mL Lo-Bind microcentrifuge tube for long term storage.
* Take the remaining < 5 &micro;L DNA extract to quantify on the Nanodrop and discard tube after.
* Write a card label to put inside the sample box, containing your name, date, and details about the project and species that were extracted.
* Place tubes and labels in a sample box and store at -20&#176;C [IMPORTANT NOTE: do not store your extractions in a tube rack or in the eDNA freezer].

### Appendix 1. Notes on buffers

You have several choices of buffer to store your DNA in. 

* The most simple is just molecular grade water, but this is typically acidic and damages DNA, and offers no protection from nucleases. Only use if you are using and discarding the DNA immediately.
* Buffer TE (in the Qiagen kits this is called Buffer AE) comprises molecular grade water with 10 mM Tris and 0.1-1 mM EDTA (depending on formulation). The Tris makes the solution alkaline, thus protecting from acid hydrolysis, and the EDTA inhibits enzyme activity, thus protecting from nucleases. It is the best long term protection for the DNA. However, the EDTA may also inhibit your downstream applications that use enzymes, such as restriction digestion (PCR is usually fine). Only use this buffer if you know what you will do with the samples.
* Tris buffer (in the Qiagen kits this is called Buffer EB) is the same as TE buffer, but without the EDTA. This is the safest option if you don't know what the samples will be used for.
* To make 10 mL of 10 mM Tris EB buffer, add 100 &micro;L of 1 M Tris solution to 9.9 mL of molecular grade water (can use the scales to weigh the water).
